# 🏠 Gros Village - Machi Koro-Like

**Gros Village** is a strategic card game where players build and optimize their cities to accumulate coins and achieve victory. Inspired by the famous board game, this project is a digital adaptation featuring interactive features, smooth animations, and an intuitive interface.

This project was created in one week as a school project, similar to a GameJam.
